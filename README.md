# genius-parser
A simple parser to extract strings out of a .genius file for anyone else who is no longer able to run Genius on mac since the 64-bit update.

Instructions:
You must first make a new empty file called 'something.genius', then copy and paste the contents of your actual .genius file into it. Then simply update the input file name in genius_parser.py and let it run. it will generate a .txt file of the same name, which will contain a new line for every extracted string. There is also an "ignore list" that you can customize for strings that the software itself generated, or anything else you want to filter out of the final result.
